# UMKC---Software-Project-1-C-
CS201R

A C++ project from a 200-level programming course.<br/>
Program objectives include:<br/>
--> Managing dynamic memory inside class objects<br/>
--> Use dynamic arrays within a program<br/>
--> Using I/O and manipulating the data<br/>

The premise of this program is to create code that will manage a library's content system.<br/>
This is accomplished by reading in user and book data (typically from a bar code scanner)<br/>
and comparing that information against the library's book records.<br/>
